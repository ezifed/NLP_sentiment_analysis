Movie sentiment analysis - Machine Learning and NPL

Sentiment Analysis is a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). One application of sentiment analysis is to predict whether a movie review should be classified as positive or negative using machine learning classification algorithms.

This project will present a simplied version of sentiment analysis on movie reviews, compiled by Andrew Maas in 2011.http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/. The dataset is a binary sentiment classification that includes 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.

@InProceedings{maas-EtAl:2011:ACL-HLT2011, author = {Maas, Andrew L. and Daly, Raymond E. and Pham, Peter T. and Huang, Dan and Ng, Andrew Y. and Potts, Christopher}, title = {Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies}, month = {June}, year = {2011}, address = {Portland, Oregon, USA}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {142--150}, url = {http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1015} }

Because the dataset divides each category of movie reviews in different folder, I used a complete txt file combined by Aaron Kub in his Guthub page: https://github.com/aaronkub/machine-learning-examples/tree/master/imdb-sentiment-analysis.
